# 🚀 Live_Wormhole

## 🌌 Project Overview
Step into a retro-futuristic hyperspace tunnel crafted using **Three.js** and **WebGL** — an immersive experience blending neon grids, animated cubes, and sci-fi aesthetics. Inspired by TRON and Interstellar, this project takes creative coding to a whole new dimension.

## ✨ Features
- **Neon Hyperspace Tunnel:** A glowing, animated tunnel with dynamic 3D cubes.
- **Motion Blur:** Smooth, realistic motion effects for added immersion.
- **Particle Effects:** Floating particles to create a sense of depth and movement.
- **Interactive Camera Controls:** Move through the tunnel with user-controlled camera motion.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Lights react to movement, adding realism and excitement.
- **Portal Transitions:** Seamless shifts between tunnels, simulating interdimensional travel.
- **Time-Warp Effect:** The tunnel bends and stretches based on speed, intensifying the journey.
- **Sound-Reactive Elements:** Visuals pulse and glow in sync with the beats of your music.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Three.js:** 3D graphics rendering
- **JavaScript:** Core logic and interactivity
- **HTML & CSS:** Structure and styling
- **WebGL:** Hardware-accelerated graphics

## 🚧 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository link]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd live_wormhole
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local server:
